# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-30

### Added

- 4 new tools auto-discovered from the manifest:
  - `cancel_order` — cancel a future-scheduled `send-sms` order before dispatch (`POST /v1/cancel-order/json`).
  - `get_reports` — list order summaries within a date range, max 10 days per call (`POST /v1/get-reports/json`).
  - `iys_register` — register İYS (Turkish messaging consent registry) records, batch up to 5000 per call (`POST /v1/consent/create/json`).
  - `iys_check` — look up the current İYS consent status for a single recipient (`POST /v1/consent/show/json`).

### Changed

- `send-sms` `iys` field description sharpened with concrete decision examples (KVKK 6563 §1 transactional exemption, APITEST sender → `iys` must be `"0"`); behavior unchanged.
- `send-sms` `request_shape` aligns `iysList` as conditional (closes the drift Copilot flagged on iletimerkezi-website PR #100).
- `iys-register` `brandCode` schema retained as `string|integer` after live verification on 2026-04-30 confirmed both types are accepted by `/v1/consent/create/json` and `/v1/consent/show/json`.

### Notes

No source-code changes were required — the server's tool list is generated from `https://www.iletimerkezi.com/api/manifest.json` at boot. Existing installations pick up the new tools after the 24h cache expires; refresh by deleting `~/.cache/iletimerkezi-mcp/manifest.json` or republishing the npm package (the `prepublishOnly` hook ships a fresh manifest snapshot in `dist/manifest.fallback.json`).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added

- Initial release with 7 MVP tools: `send_sms`, `get_report`, `get_balance`, `get_sender`, `get_blacklist`, `add_blacklist`, `delete_blacklist`.
- Manifest loader with three-tier resolution: live fetch (5s timeout) → 24h on-disk cache → build-time fallback shipped in the npm tarball.
- Generic tool dispatcher that wraps user input in the iletiMerkezi `request.authentication` envelope; per-tool shape comes from the manifest's `input_schema`.
- Authentication via `ILETIMERKEZI_API_KEY` + `ILETIMERKEZI_API_HASH` env vars; 401 responses surface the panel's "Allow API access" toggle directly in the tool error.
- `ILETIMERKEZI_MANIFEST_URL` and `ILETIMERKEZI_MCP_CACHE_DIR` env overrides for staging / development environments.
- `prepublishOnly` hook fetches the live manifest and writes it to `dist/manifest.fallback.json` so every published version ships with a current snapshot.
- 15 unit tests (auth, manifest cache/fallback, tool dispatch, 401 guidance, Markdown stripping) and an offline `tools/list` smoke script.
